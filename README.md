# Vandos
This is a basic OS developed by Balázs Horváth.
Some part of the sources and ideas are from the following projects:
 - MikeOS (currently available at http://mikeos.sourceforge.net)
 - OS Development Series (found at http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html)

# Goals
Mainly my goal is to learn low-level languages (Assembly and C) and learn the basics of an operating system.
Since I'm really into game develpment, it is possible, that the OS will include game server functionalities, at least i hope so, i have some great ideas. :)

I also hope, that this project will help people learn some stuff.
